# ProofSystem/LatticeReductions.spec.md

## Purpose

- **What it is**: MSIS-to-Ajtai binding reduction theorems that derive Ajtai commitment security from Module-SIS hardness.
- **Key property**: `ajtaiBoundaries_of_msis` bundles standard + relaxed binding consequences in probabilistic-bound form (negligible + advantage bounds) over the reduction carrier `C`.
- **Protocol role**: Provides the lattice-security reduction consumed by `ProtocolTheorem` to close the protocol's security proof under MSIS hardness.

## Target Formulas

- `‖subVec n w₁ w₂‖∞ < msisNormBound` = norm transfer from binding collision witnesses (standard: 2B, relaxed: 4TB per Theorem 2).
- `MSISHardnessAssumption → ∃ ε_MSIS, negl(ε_MSIS) ∧ Adv_MSIS ≤ ε_MSIS` = `msisAdvantageBound_of_hardness`.
- `MSISHardnessAssumption → MSISHardnessBoundary` = `MSISHardnessBoundary.ofHardness`.
- `AjtaiBindingAdvantageBound + IsNegligible → AjtaiBindingAssumption` = `no_ajtaiBindingCollision_of_advantageBound`.
- `AjtaiRelaxedBindingAdvantageBound + IsNegligible → AjtaiRelaxedBindingAssumption` = `no_ajtaiRelaxedBindingCollision_of_advantageBound`.
- `MSISHardnessAssumption → AjtaiBindingAssumption(params) ∧ AjtaiRelaxedBindingAssumption(params, C)` = `ajtaiBoundaries_of_msis`.

## Proof Obligations

- All theorem statements must hold without `sorry`.
- No module-level `axiom`s; carrier/algebra laws that are not definitional are threaded explicitly via `LatticeReductionLaws` and carried in `MSISToAjtaiReductions` only for the abstract carrier-parametric route.
- The specialized `paperCarrier` and Goldilocks constructors reconstruct the internal MSIS boundary theorem-natively from the theorem-level MSIS hardness assumption, then derive Ajtai error/bound packaging and strong-sampling packaging from that boundary together with the proved sampling bounds.

## Assumption Ledger

Generic carrier-parametric boundary assumptions are explicit in `LatticeReductionLaws`:

- `strongSampling`: supply `strongSamplingExpansionProp` for the chosen sampling carrier.
  Closure target: instantiate via `LatticeReductionLaws.ofCarrier`, `.ofPaperCarrier`, or `.ofPaperCarrierFromBounds` with a concrete sampling set proof.

Relaxed-collision carrier membership is explicit in collision witnesses:
- `RelaxedBindingCollision params C` carries `inDiff1 : samplingDiffSet C delta1`
- `RelaxedBindingCollision params C` carries `inDiff2 : samplingDiffSet C delta2`

Derived internally (not a boundary field):
- `normInfVec_subVec_le_derived`: vector subtraction norm triangle, proved in-module.
- `smulVec_comm_derived`: commutation of nested ring-vector scalar actions, proved from ring multiplication.
- `matVecMul_smulVec_derived`: matrix/scalar compatibility, proved from `dotRq` linearity and ring multiplication.
- `normInfVec_smulVec_le_of_diff`: vector-level bound
  \(\|\delta \cdot v\|_\infty \le 4T\cdot B\) proved from `strongSampling` + `normInfVec` max aggregation.

## Dependency and Consumer Map

- **Dependencies**: `SuperNeo.ProofSystem.Lattice` (uses structures, vector operations, and boundary package typeclass).
- **Consumers**:
  - `SuperNeo.ProtocolTheorem`: imports `LatticeReductions` for `ajtaiBoundaries_of_msis` in the final theorem.
  - `SuperNeo.ProofSystem.Protocol`: uses reduction bundle in the proof-system capstone.

## Design Notes

- The module separates the abstract carrier-parametric route from the specialized `paperCarrier` / Goldilocks route.
- `LatticeReductionLaws` records the explicit carrier-side laws needed for the abstract route.
- The specialized constructors expose the concrete paper-facing route without reintroducing those abstract laws at the final-theorem surface.

## Quality Expectations

- All reduction theorems proved without sorry.
- Clear norm-transfer chain from collision to MSIS break.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `lake build` succeeds.
- All theorems type-check without sorry.
- Spec documents Theorem 2 with line ranges.

## Out of Scope

- Concrete MSIS advantage computation (abstracted via `MSISAdvantageBound`).
- Probabilistic game semantics for challenger/adversary.
