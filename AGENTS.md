# AGENTS.md

## General
- We don't care about backwards compatibility because we are still in development. Keep the code simple and lean.
- Avoid adding new Rust features or ENVs unless it is explicitly approved.
- Never modify this file without explicit approval.
- No single file should ever exceed 1,500 lines of code unless explicitly confirmed by the user.

## Testing
- Never add tests in the same implementation file, always prefer to add them to a file inside tests/ (current or new)
- If you add a test to catch a problem, the test should fail if aims to confirm a problem.
- Always use `FoldingMode::Optimized` in tests. Never use `FoldingMode::PaperExact` unless the user explicitly approves it. PaperExact is an O(2^ell) brute-force reference engine meant only for correctness cross-checking, not general test usage.

## Build & Test Commands
- When running tests use --release eg cargo test --workspace --release
- For extra debugs use debug-logs eg --features paper-exact,debug-logs

## Formal Lean Subproject (`formal/superneo-lean`)
- Use this 3-layer layout for each formalized component:
  - Human spec: `formal/superneo-lean/specs/<Name>.spec.md`
  - Typed Lean interface: `formal/superneo-lean/SuperNeo/<Name>Interface.lean`
  - Lean implementation: `formal/superneo-lean/SuperNeo/<Name>.lean`
- Closure standard (mandatory): **Paper-faithful proof-complete**.
  - A module is only considered complete when the exact mathematical construction/claim from
    `./formal/superneo-lean/SuperNeo.pdf.md` is proved in Lean at quantified theorem level.
  - Regression checks (`lake exe check`, generated vectors, booleans) are required but are never
    sufficient evidence for completion.
  - Interface-level or assumption-level closure (`Done (Boundary)`) is intermediate only.
  - Do not claim proof completion by redefining theorem-facing surfaces to be definitionally equal
    to the target expression while leaving the executable/paper construction unproved; prove the
    bridge theorem explicitly.
  - Any trusted assumption/axiom that remains must be explicit, minimal, and accompanied by a
    concrete closure plan in the module spec and README.
- Project-local skill for this workflow:
  - Path: `./.codex/skills/superneo-lean-interface-spec/SKILL.md`
  - Purpose: create/update per-module Lean contract pairs
    (`SuperNeo/<Name>Interface.lean` + `specs/<Name>.spec.md`).
  - Use when: standardizing specs, adding missing interface/spec files, or
    auditing assumptions/consumers against `./formal/superneo-lean/SuperNeo.pdf.md`.
- Keep interface files colocated with implementations (Objective-C style), not in a separate top-level folder.
- `*.spec.md` is the external/human-facing specification; `*Interface.lean` is the machine-checked boundary.
- Specs must be **stateless**: they describe the timeless mathematical target (what the module must achieve), never the current implementation progress. Do not use language like "currently proved", "not yet implemented", "scaffold", "pending", or "in progress" in specs. A spec should read identically whether the module is 0% or 100% complete.
- Avoid naming Lean boundary files as `*Spec.lean` or `*Contract.lean` to prevent confusion with prose specs and crypto terminology.
- Interfaces should expose theorem/definition shapes and boundary assumptions clearly; implementations should satisfy or instantiate those interfaces.
- Prefer thin/stable interfaces and keep implementation details out of `*Interface.lean`.

## Perf & Constraint Debugging

Perf tests live in `crates/neo-fold/tests/suites/perf/single_addi_metrics_nightstream.rs`. All use `--ignored`.

Full constraint architecture report (main CCS, bus, Route-A claims, openings, timing):
```bash
NS_DEBUG_N=10 cargo test -p neo-fold --release --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture report_track_a_w0_w1_snapshot
```
N: number of riscv instructions + 1 (halt).

Other useful tests (all accept `NS_DEBUG_N`):
- `debug_trace_single_n_mixed_ops` — trace-wiring prove/verify + openings
- `debug_chunked_single_n_mixed_ops` — same in chunked trace mode
- `debug_trace_vs_chunked_single_n_mixed_ops` — side-by-side comparison
- `report_trace_vs_chunked_medians` — 5-run median timing
- `debug_trace_core_rows_per_cycle_equiv` — CCS rows/cycle (no prove, fast; uses `NS_DEBUG_T`)

## Profiling

| Tool | Use Case | Output |
|------|----------|--------|
| `profile_for_ai.sh` | Quick CPU profiling, filters system calls | `profile-output.txt` |
| `profile_xctrace.sh` | Full detail + Instruments GUI (supports `--template`) | `profile-xctrace.txt` + `.trace` |
| `profile_memory_deep.sh` | Memory allocation debugging | Text with allocation sites |

Usage: `./scripts/<tool> <package> <test_file> <test_function> [--ignored]`

For xctrace, add `--template <name>` (Allocations, Leaks, File Activity, System Trace, etc.)

Examples:
```bash
./scripts/profile_for_ai.sh neo-fold test_sha256_single_step test_sha256_preimage_4k --ignored
./scripts/profile_xctrace.sh neo-fold test_sha256_single_step test_sha256_preimage_4k --ignored
./scripts/profile_xctrace.sh neo-fold test_sha256_single_step test_sha256_preimage_4k --ignored --template Allocations
./scripts/profile_memory_deep.sh neo-fold test_sha256_single_step test_sha256_preimage_4k --ignored
```
